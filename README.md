# Electronics & Arduino Reference Cards

Business card-sized references for Arduino and basic electronics. I hand these out at workshops along with a couple LEDs and a coin cell all in a 3x4" Ziplock-style bag.

These are NOT exhaustive references, this is by design. 80/20 principle applies...the most common and essential information in the least space. They're designed for beginners and the goal wasn't really to answer all questions, but to plant seeds: "Oh yeah, those resistor stripes mean something" or "Oh yeah, more current needs bigger wire" -- serious study then takes place elsewhere. Case in point, 5-band resistors aren't even mentioned, too esoteric at this early stage of learning.

The reverse of each card is flipped on purpose. Placed on a desk, it's easier to turn the cards over vertically.

Card #1 doesn't contain any technical data but serves a vital function. First, as a memory jog..."What was that stuff called that looks like neon?" or "What are those little motors called again?" Second, to provide electronics with a "face" (literally!) ...that it's not all dry facts and formulas, that this is a human interest story, that it can include art and fashion. I always put this card on top in the packets, so a smiling face is the first thing people see!

Adobe Illustrator format. These are sized for Vistaprint's standard business card template. While not the absolute finest quality, they do okay and provide good value...getting these in the most hands possible was the goal. Rounded corners (optional) add a touch of class and won't cut off anything vital. Vistaprint WILL complain about the layout (upside-down card backs, etc.) but this can usually be ignored, as long as the preview comps look correct.
